# Programming Assignment # 3

## I. Intended Learning Outcomes: 
#### 1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library 
#### 2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library 
## II. Instructions: 
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter 
notebook in the dedicated submission bin. 
For this programming assignment,  download the following file and save to your default user folder:

PROBLEM 1: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py 
Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations: 

a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas 

b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars. 

PROBLEM 2: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py 
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and 
indexing operations. 

a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars. 

b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’. 

c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have? 

d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 
Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.
